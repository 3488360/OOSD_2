When starting the game, make sure that Layouts.txt is located in the project folder otherwise the game will not start.
The timer input box must contain an integer. 60 is the default.
Player 1 is yellow and player 2 is grey.

Known Bugs:
	- Can attack any opponents pieces on the board. Doesn't matter about location. (Not required to fix for assignment 1)
	- The colouring of the board isn't 100%. Sometimes the white colouring doesn't work. (Minor)
	- No error checking on input boxes on settings screen. For now, it assumes the user has entered the correct information.
	- The game cannot be won yet. The game the winning conditions need to be added.
	- The test piece (has a K icon) is meant for testing purposes only. Not meant for final game.
	- Under some circumstances, the current player can make the opponent attack their own pieces. (Not required to fix for assignment 1)
	- The healer piece can only heal the opponent...
